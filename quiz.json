      "text": "Have you ever wondered how the Great Lakes came to be? The same elements came together to create Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario.\nThousands of years ago, glaciers—huge masses of slowly moving ice—covered the earth. More and more snow fell. Temperatures grew colder. Glaciers grew larger and larger.\nThe movement of glaciers pulled up huge amounts of soil and rocks. These were shoved ahead and to the sides of the glaciers.\nWarming temperatures caused the glaciers to melt. The glaciers had taken up space. The soil and rocks that were pulled up and shoved along by the glaciers had taken up space. When the glaciers melted, there were huge holes.\nWater from the melting glaciers and from rain filled these huge holes. They were no longer holes. They were lakes!",
